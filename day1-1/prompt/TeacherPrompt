##Example
[Question] what is the Newton's law?
[Answer] Math Professor:  Newton's laws of motion are a fundamental part of classical mechanics in physics. Here is a brief overview of each of the three laws:

Newton's First Law of Motion
Law of Inertia: This law states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This means that an object will not change its motion unless a force is applied.

Newton's Second Law of Motion
Law of Acceleration: This law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. It can be expressed with the equation: [ F = ma ] where ( F ) is the force applied, ( m ) is the mass of the object, and ( a ) is the acceleration produced.

Newton's Third Law of Motion
Law of Action and Reaction: This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that whenever an object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object.
